Compared with the regular BMW 2-series, this souped-up coupe badass boasts a meaner mug and wider hips, a chassis tuned for attacking racetracks, and a more powerful engine. The hard-charging, high-revving twin-turbo straight-six eats up straightaways quicker than Kobayashi downs hot dogs. While we prepare for the extinction of manual transmissions, this little BMW still fights for the resistance. It offers a snappy dual-clutch automatic, too. Its harsh ride and unimpressive interior are less contentious on the more affordable M240i, but the true M car is terrific specifically because its an uncompromising drivers car. /The M2s snorty twin-turbo 3.0-liter inline-six is a sweetheart of an engine, and it pumps out 405 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque. That combination reaches the rear wheels via a standard six-speed manual transmission or an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The engine moves the M2 with an unbridled ferocity and creates stomach butterflies as you rev it to the 7600-rpm redline. Like an explicit scene from Fifty Shades of Grey, the M2s punishing ride needs a safe word. But there isnt one. Those willing to accept the abuse on regular roads will be rewarded with pure ecstasy on the track. There, the M2 handles like an extension of its driver, with gleefully violent thrust and a clairvoyant chassis. Harsh ride aside, the M2 is a phenomenal drivers car. Namby-pamby drivers who complain will find solace in the softer BMW M240i. Instead of the adaptive dampers available on most rivals, the BMW uses conventional passive shocks tuned the old-fashioned way. Too bad the electrically assisted power steering spoils some of the fun. The M2 has massive rotors and powerful binders that provide excellent pedal feedback that never fades.')

Both feature a brilliant twin-turbo six-cylinder engine that is as refined as it is powerful, and their "M" designation means theyre descendants of BMWs storied subdivision. Available as a coupe or convertible, the M4 is zestier than the regular 4-series. While its cornering grip and stopping power are as impressive as any, the two-door Bimmer doesnt reward its driver as much as its forebearers.

Our M4 Competition test car with the automatic zipped from zero to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds, the same time it took its main rival, the Mercedes-AMG C63 S coupe. The ride is firm but the driver is paid back for the abuse with genuine agility on twisty roads.

Three different powertrains are offered—including a plug-in hybrid model and a high-performance twin-turbo V-8—and the X5s road manners are decidedly athletic. Its styling is attractive without being overly flashy, and the interior treats occupants with quality materials, comfortable seats, and a plethora of convenience and luxury features. It faces heady competition from the likes of the Audi Q7, the Porsche Cayenne, and the Mercedes-Benz GLE-class, but the X5 is a richly outfitted package well-equipped for the task at hand. /For 2021 there are now three distinct powertrains, each associated with a different X5 model. X5s wearing the sDrive40i or xDrive40i badge are powered by a 335-hp turbocharged inline-six.

Last but not least, the M50is 523-hp twin-turbo V-8 enables it to rush to 60 mph in less than four seconds. All three powertrains are paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission, and none of them will leave drivers wanting for power in virtually any driving situation. The X5s refined ride and stable handling are a big improvement compared with the previous-generation model, as is its steering, which feels more connected and direct but still not exactly what wed consider sporting. The Q7 still has the X5 beat in this area, but its a close match. Pitch the X5 into a fast corner, and it holds on reliably and rewards the driver with a predictability thats missing from the GLE-class.

Theres also a plug-in hybrid for the green crowd. While were saddened by BMWs decision to eliminate the 3s manual transmission, the perceptive eight-speed automatic is a worthy substitute. Whats more, the 3s fantastic chassis can seamlessly shift from calm to frisky at a moments notice. Unfortunately, its steering—although improved over the previous generations—still lacks the tactility that enthusiasts once idolized. The 2021 3-series fulfills its mission as an entry-level premium sedan with ample cabin and trunk space as well as copious amounts of luxury and technology. /The 3-series offers two smooth and potent gas-powered engines.

The 330e plug-in hybrid combines a turbo 2.0-liter engine with an electric motor that together generate 288 horses and 310 pound-feet. Our first impression of the 330e revealed a harmonious relationship between the gas and electric elements, and we like the plug-ins new Xtraboost function that provides a burst of power that feels like a shot of nitrous. Each powertrain pairs with an exceptional eight-speed automatic transmission and standard rear-wheel drive. You can power all four wheels for a price. Unfortunately, a manual gearbox is no longer available. (Purists should hold out for the all-new BMW M3 if they need the stick.) Buyers can choose between two suspension setups on the 3: the base arrangement or the upgrade with adaptive dampers. Our first drive of this G20-gen 3-series was encouraging. The cars newfound steering feel provides more road-surface information and variable effort than its predecessor did, but its still lacking compared with that of the 3s iconic early generations. The four-cylinder Bimmer proved its worth by winning a comparison test against other sports sedans. We applauded its ability to transition from relaxed and refined to sharp and playful. The 330i also secured its spot at the top of its class by thwarting the gorgeous Alfa Romeo Giulia in a two-car comparo.

INSERT INTO [dbo].[Cars] ([Owner], [Brand], [Model], [Type], [Tranmission], [Seat], [Door], [Price],[Image],[Description]) VALUES ('jobber','Lexus','RC500','Coupe','Automatic',4,2,145,'lexusRC500.jpg','The RC looks exciting enough to fool onlookers into thinking that its actually a high-powered, sharp-edged sports cars. Despite several powertrain combinations, none of them give the RC a distinct personality, which is true for some of its most popular rivals. Still, the Lexus has a refined ride quality and a spacious front seat that make it more of a grand tourer than a corner carver. Its quirky infotainment system and cramped back seat are offset by an array of desirable features and standard driver assists. While the 2020 RC will disappoint ardent enthusiasts, itll satisfy drivers seeking comfort over sport.	 /	The RC300 is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder making 241 horsepower and mated exclusively to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is its only setup. We found the automatic to be a good match for the turbo four, but the engine isnt up to the task of pulling the RC around with any alacrity. Lexus offers two versions of its V-6 to address the lack of power. Under the hood of the all-wheel-drive RC300, the V-6 makes 255 horsepower and pairs with a six-speed automatic. The range-topping RC350 gets a 306-hp V-6 that teams up with the eight-speed automatic (RWD only) or the six-speed (AWD only). In our testing, weve found this engine to be velvety smooth with linear power delivery, but its still not as gutsy as its rivals. While it managed a 5.7-second run from zero to 60 mph, the BMW 440i coupe we tested did the deed in 4.4 seconds. Ride comfort is where the RC succeeds—and it does so with honors. Upgrading to larger wheels with lower profile tires, as featured on the RC350 F Sport we tested, does put a sharper edge on the ride, but it is never harsh. The RC is not as eager as tauter coupes when it comes to enthusiastic driving, but theres still some room to play.
